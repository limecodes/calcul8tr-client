# Calcul8r - Basic Calculator using React & Node API

## Requirements

1. Calculator must have at least 4 basic operations
2. Separated UI & API (In other words not a monorepo)
3. Code must be extendable, for example to extend "Calculator" to implement "Scientific Calculator" with more operations

## Technical Considerations

- I'm not using `create-react-app` to scaffold the project, instead I'm doing all configurations by hand to avoid blind configuration so that I have full control over the dependencies that I'm installing and using

## Installation Instructions

1. `git clone <this repo>`
1. `cd <this project>`
1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn run start`
