# Calcul8r - Basic Calculator using React & Node API

## Requirements

1. Calculator must have at least 4 basic operations
2. Separated UI & API (In other words not a monorepo)
3. Code must be extendable, for example to extend "Calculator" to implement "Scientific Calculator" with more operations

## Technical Considerations

- I'm not using `create-react-app` to scaffold the project, instead I'm doing all configurations by hand to avoid blind configuration so that I have full control over the dependencies that I'm installing and using

## Required Dependencies

_Main Dependencies_

- React
- ReactDOM

_Dev Dependencies_

- eslint
- prettier
- @babel/core
- @babel/preset-env
- @babel/preset-react
- babel-loader
- css-loader
- style-loader
- html-webpack-plugin
- webpack
- webpack-cli
- webpack-dev-server
- jest
